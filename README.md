# 1st semester front-end-project

html, css, bootstrap and just a bit of Jquerry. I had to create the logo as well.
All pictureare randomly taken to fill in the project which was a 4 pages website for a new 3d printing startup.

If you look into the js file there is a really usefull smooth scroll function ;)
